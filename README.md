# 21-Days-of-Cloud
I created this repo to document my learning journey and my preparation for the AWS Clod Practitioner certification exam over the next 21 days.

## Day 01 (02-04-2022)
Today, 
- I got a foundational glimpse of what cloud computing is.
- Types of cloud deployment models like;
  - Public cloud
  - Private cloud
  - Hybrid cloud
- Key cloud concepts such as;
  - Scalability
  - Economy of scale
  - Security etc.
  - On demand resources
- Types of cloud service models;
  - Software as a Service(SaaS)
  - Platform as a Service(PaaS)
  - Inftasture as a Service(IaaS)
- Use cases of Cloud e.g Migrating from on-premise, Traffic bursting, Web hosting etc.
- I also learnt about how Datacenter architecture is reflected in the cloud.

## Day 02 (03-04-2022)
Today, I started a deep dive into the AWS compute fundamentals. Here I was able to learn about some AWS services and their core components. 
- Some of the services I learnt were the;
  - AWS Elastic Compute Cloud called EC2 and a short demo on how an EC2 is created.
  - AWS Elastic Container Service called the ECS
  - Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) 
  - Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk and its workflow.

## Day 03 (04-04-2022)
Today, I learnt more about other AWS services and their components:
  - AWS Lambda and how to work with it.
  - AWS Batch
  - Amazon Lightsail and how it can be configured.
  - What AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is, the types and how each type can be configured.
  - I also learnt about what server certificates (SSL/TSL) are.

## Day 04 (08-04-2022)
Took some time off to review the things I had learnt previously.
Continuing the challenge today, I studied about;
💢 what EC2 auto scaling is
💢 it's advantages
💢 auto scaling components and how they are configured.

## Day 05 (09-04-2022)
Today, I did an hands-on lab on how to create my very first EC2 instance.
